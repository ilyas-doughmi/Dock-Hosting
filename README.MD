# DockHosting 

DockHosting is a lightweight Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) simulation built to explore the intersection of web development and DevOps.

####  ⚠️ Educational Project: This project was created specifically to upgrade my skills in PHP, SQL, and Docker. It is a learning experiment, not a production-ready hosting service.
